Computer Vision

Multi-modal learning

* different representations , unbalance between heterogeneous feature spaces , biased on a specific modality

Visual data & Text

* image tagging (word2vec)

* image captioning

    * show and tell (CNN + LSTM)

    * show, attend and tell (RNN with attention)

* text-to-image by generative model , visual question answering

3D perspective

* 3D datasets : shapeNet , PartNet , SceneNet , ScanNet , Outdoor 3D scene datasets

* 3D object recognition , 3D object detection , 3D semantic segmentation , Mesh R-CNN

* Photo refocusing (depth map)

Implementation

* Image captioning
