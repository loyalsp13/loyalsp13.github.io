Computer Vision

* Similar to Week 3 (Day 3)

* Image data augmentation

    * Crop, Shear, Brightness, Perspective, Rotate, flip, cutmix

    * RandAugment = automatically find the best sequence of augmentations

        * which augmentation to apply, magnitude of augmentation to apply

* Leveraging pre-trained information

    * transfer learning = use pre-trained knowledge for many tasks (motivational observation)

        * replace classifier / fine-tuning the whole model

    * knowledge distilattion = teacher-student network structure

        * minimize KL div loss between teacher model and student model

        * soft label is used to represent knowledge

        * softmax with temperature = normalize softmax value

* Leveraging unlabeled dataset for training

    * Semi-supervised learning

        * we have only small labeled dataset

        * train teacher with labeled dataset

        * predict unlabeled dataset (pseudo-labeled dataset)

        * train student with labeled + pseudo-labeled dataset

        * student becomes new teacher

        * student becomes more complex than teacher

* Self-training (augmentation + teacher-student + semi-supervised learning) has SOTA on ImageNet classification

* implementation

    * data augmentation with numpy and opencv

* Assignment

    * vgg11 image classification (compare accuracy between pre-trained / not)
