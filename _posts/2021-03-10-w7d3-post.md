Computer Vision

* Similar to Week 3 (Day 3)

Object detection

* Two-stage detector (R-CNN family)

    * R-CNN , Fast R-CNN , Faster R-CNN

* Single-stage detector

    * YOLO

    * SSD : use multi-scale outputs attached to multiple feature maps -> diverse space of possible box shapes

    * RetinaNet

* Class imbalance problem -> Focal loss

* Detection with transformer : DETR

* detecting objects as points

CNN Visualization

* low level feature (mood) / middle level feature / high level feature (specific)

* embedding feature analysis

    * Nearest neighbors in a feature space , dimensionality reduction

* activation investigation

    * layer activation , maximally activating patches

    * class visualization : generate image that triggers maximal class activation

* model decision explanation

    * occulsion map , derivatives of a class score w.r.t. input domain

    * Rectified unit (backward pass)

        * Relu, deconvnet (guided backpropagation)

    * class activation mapping

        * global average pooling layer instead of the FC layer

        * Grad-CAM

        * SCOUTER

implementation

* Introduction to torch.autograd , 

Assignment

* CNN visualization
