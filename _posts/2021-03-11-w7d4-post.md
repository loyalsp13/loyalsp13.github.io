Computer Vision

Instance segmentation (Stuff + Things)

* Mask R-CNN = Faster R-CNN + Mask branch

* YOLACT , YolactEdge

Panoptic segmentation

* UPSNet , VPSNet

Landmark localization

* Coordinate regression , Heatmap classification

* hourglass network

* densepose , retinaface

Detecting objects as keypoints

* CornerNet , CenterNet

Conditional generative model

* audio super resolution , machine translation , article generation with the title , image-to-image translation , style transfer

* Super resolution

    * MAE, MSE, GAN loss 

    * SRGAN

Image translation GANs

* Pix2Pix , CycleGAN 

* Perceptual loss = compute style and feature losses

* feature reconstruction loss = L2 loss between the feature maps

* style reconstruction loss = L2 loss between the gram matrices generated from the feature maps

GAN applications

* Deepfake , face de-identification , video translation

Assignment

* Hourglass network
