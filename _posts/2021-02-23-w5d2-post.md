Graph

* pagerank

    * find webpages which reliable and related with user keyword by voting

    * large |Nin(v)| is reliable -> can be manipulated -> reliable websites voting has more power -> recursion

    * vote = self.pagerank_score / Nout(v)

    * pagerank score = sum of vote

    * random walk converges like voting strategy

    * calculate pagerank score by power iteration

        * not always converges (spider trap)

        * not always meaningful value (dead end)

    * use teleport with damping factor

* decision making propagation model

    * linear threshold model

        * choose larger reward between neighbors

* probability propagation model

    * independent cascade model

        * propagation with probability (virus)

* viral marketing
    
    * use hubs (seed set) and propagation model

    * influence maximization problem

        * impossible to find optimal seed set

        * Node centrality , greedy algorithm

* implementation

    * calculate pagerank score, propagation model simulator

# Assignment
