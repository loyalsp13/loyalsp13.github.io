Graph

* Graph basic

    * vertex , node , edge , link

    * node classification , link prediction , recommendation , community detection ...

    * undirected graph vs directed graph , unweighted graph vs weighted graph , unpartite graph vs bipartite graph

    * G = (V, E) , N(v) , Nout(v) , Nin(v)

* real graph vs random graph

    * In random graph, each nodes are connected with probability (independent)

* small-world effect

    * path , distance , diameter

    * six degrees of separation : in real world, every people are connected with average six to seven degrees

    * chain, cycle graph has no small-world effect

* probability distributions with heavy tails

    * in real world, highly connected node, hub exist

    * there is no hub in random graph

* connected component

    * in real world, there is giant connected component

    * giant connected component includes most of nodes

    * random graph also has giant connected component (average degree should be higher than 1)

* community

    * local clustering coefficient : propotion of connected neighbors

    * high local clustering coeffienct tends to make community

    * global clustering coefficient : average of local clustering coefficient

    * real graph (many community) vs random graph (less community)

* implementation

    * calculate global clustering coefficient , diameter

# Assignment

implement graph module

# Peer Session

* review Self-supervised Pre-training Models
