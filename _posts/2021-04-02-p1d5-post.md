* Experiment Toolkits & Tips

# Implementation

* train three different models for age, mask, gender classification

* train-validation split

    * images from one person are not splitted

* collect asian age >= 60 dataset (no mask)

    * train with no mask images -> age propotion 3:3:2
    
    * proper train, validation accuracy -> but low test accuracy
