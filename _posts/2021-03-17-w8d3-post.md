Compression

mini code

* list operations

* Masking

Issues

* Acceleration

    * python list vs numpy array , python vs C

    * CPU vs GPU

    * FPGA

    * DL compiler

* Pruning

    * Inference speed , Regularization brings generalization

    * Information loss , granularity affects the efficiency of hardware accelerator design

    * remove weights which have close value to 0

    * pruning vs Dropout

    * retrain after pruning makes higher accuracy

    * unstructured pruning vs structured pruning (channel, kernel , layer)

    * iterative magnitude pruning (with rewinding)

    * lottery ticket hypothesis

toy code

* parallel processing

* why is pruned model larger?
