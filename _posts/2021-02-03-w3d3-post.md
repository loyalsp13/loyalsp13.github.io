# Lecture
Convolutional Neural Network

* stride , padding

* stack of (convolution, pooling) layer + fully connected layer

* convolution layer has less paramters rather than fully connected layer

Modern CNN

* Performance increases while parameter size decreases

* AlexNet

    * ReLU activation (vanishing gradient)
    
    * 2 GPUs , data augmentation , dropout

* VGGNet

    * 3x3 convolution : two 3x3 convolution have same receptive field with one 5x5 convolution but has less parameter

* GoogleNet

    * Inception blocks : use 1x1 convolution to reduce parameter size and increase depth

* ResNet

    * deeper networks are hard to train well

    * skip connection (bottleneck architecture) : f'(x) = f(x) + x , solve vanishing gradient problem

* DenseNet

    * similar to ResNet , use concatenation instead of addition

    * reduce size with 1x1 conv and pooling layer

Computer Vision application

* Semantic Segmentation

    * Fully Convolutional Network : replace fully connect layer with convolution layer -> handle various size of input

    * Deconvolution (Upsample) : rescale heatmap to original image's size

* Detection

    * R-CNN : extract bounding box , every bounding box pass network, classify output vector with SVM

    * SPPNet : image pass network once , get bounding box from feature map

    * Fast R-CNN : based on SPPNet , extract bounding box regressor

    * Faster R-CNN : extracting bounding box is also trained with Region Proposal Network
        
        * Region Proposal Network : predefined anchor boxes , extract bounding box regressor (w, h, x_offset, y_offset) , classification (use it or not)

    * YOLO

        * split image with grid

        * each cell predicts bounding boxes

        * each cell predicts class probabilities

Self study

* car name classification with CNN

    * googleimagesdownload

    * 9 classes (each has 80 ~ 90) : Audi S5 Convertible 2012,  BMW 3 Series Sedan 2012,  Ferrari California Convertible 2012,  Lamborghini Diablo Coupe 2001,  Mercedes-Benz C-Class Sedan 2012,  Porsche Panamera Sedan 2012,  Rolls-Royce Ghost Sedan 2012,  Tesla Model S Sedan 2012, Bentley Continental GT Coupe 2012

    * split train, test set with (file name, class) -> copy images to folder (train, test)

    * torch.datasets.ImageFolder : load train images (/category1, /category2, ...) , test images (/category1, /category2, ...) , auto labeling

    * 10 epoch , batch_size = 64 , 3 convolution layer + fully connected layer , Adam optimizer , data augmentation

    * 23% accuracy for test set -> small dataset , shallow network , no formal data

# Peer Session

* pytorch has pretrained model

    * import torchvision.models as models
    
        * models.resnet18() , models.vgg16() ...

# Assignment

* fill blanks of code which implementation of CNN
