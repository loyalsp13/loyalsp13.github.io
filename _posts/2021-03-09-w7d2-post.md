Computer Vision

* Beyond ResNet

    * DenseNet = concat every output along the channel axis -> reuse of features

    * SENet(Squeeze and Excitation) = adopt attention inside of CNN -> scaling feature map with attention

    * EfficientNet = adopt various method (width, depth, resolution scaling)

    * Deformable convolution = spread receptive fields

* CNN backbones = VGGNet and ResNet are used  as a backbone model for many tasks

Semantic segmentation

* Fully Convolutional Network = can be used to various input size (fc layer -> 1x1 convolutional layer)

    * limitation = predicted score map is in a very low-resolution -> upsample score map

    * transposed convolution = overlap (input * filter) -> unexpected check pattern -> interpolation

    * add skip connections for enlarging the score map -> accumulated score map is similar to ground truth

* Hypercolumns

* U-Net

    * contracting path (halve feature map size) -> expanding path (double feature map size)

    * before each pooling layer concat feature map to expanding path's input

    * every input sizes are even

* DeepLab

    * Conditional Random Fields , Dilated convolution

    * Depthwise separable convolution = reduce computation

* implementation

    * ResNet, U-Net

* Assignment

    * use vgg11 backbone model to build semantic segmentation model
