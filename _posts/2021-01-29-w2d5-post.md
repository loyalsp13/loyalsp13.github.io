# Lecture
Python matplotlib

* plt.plot() -> plt.show()

* scatter() , bar() , hist() , boxplot()

* multiple plots use grid

Python seaborn

* lineplot() , scatterplot() , countplot() , barplot() , distplot()

* multiple plots use axes

Basic math

* statistical modeling : inference probability distribution from data

* many machine learning algorithms are nonparametric method

* probability distribution candidates : category , beta , gamma , normal , bernoulli

* sampling distribution : statistic's probability distribution

* maximum likelihood estimation (mle) : argmax P(x \| &#920;)

* log likelihood is efficient to compute

* mle doesn't satisfy unbiased estimation

* categori distribution's mle : apply lagrangian multiplier

* kl divergence : cross entropy + entropy , distance between probability distribution

* minimize kl divergence with actual label and predicted label

# Peer Session

* difference between probability and likelihood

    * approach from math vs approach from data

* likelihood advantage

    * fit best for data
