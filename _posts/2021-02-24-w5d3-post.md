Graph

* community detection

    * modularity : many inner edges in community means success community detection

* Girvan-Newman algorithm

    * top-down attempt , remove edges sequentially (bridge)

    * betweenness centrality : count whether edge is belongs to shortest path

    * remove edge has highest betweenness centrality

    * each step measure modularity

* Louvain algorithm

    * bottom-up attempt , connect edges sequentially

* community detection with overlap

    * each node can belongs to several community

    * build overlap community model with probability

    * calculate graph's probability with model

    * use maximum likelihood estimate to find optimal overlap community model

* content-based recommendation

    * collect item profile (one hot encoding) -> user profile (weighted average) -> match new item with user profile (cosine similarity)

    * pros : can use for new item , special preference , don't need other user's information

    * cons : require item's additional information , cannot use for new user , overfitting

* user collaborative filtering

    * find similar users -> recommend similar users' items

    * measure similarity (correlation coefficient) -> average of weighted similarity -> expected rating 

    * pros : does not require item's additional information

    * cons : cannot use for new item , special preference

* evaluate recommendation system

    * split training data + test data -> mean squared error

* implementation

    * Girvan-Newman algorithm, evaluate recommendation system
