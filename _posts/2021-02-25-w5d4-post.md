Graph

* Node embedding

    * preserve graph's similarity at the embedding space

    * inner product : similarity in embedding space

* Transductive method

    * get specific embedding of graph

* Adjacency based approach

    * adjacent nodes are similar

    * Loss = inner product - adjacency value

    * limitation = distance does not affect to loss

* Distance based approach

* Path based approach

* Overlapped nodes based approach

    * Jaccard Similarity, Adamic Adar score

* random walk based approach

    * simlarity = probability to stop at each nodes in random walk strategy

        * probability = softmax value of inner product

    * Deepwalk = choose neighbors with same probability
    
    * Node2Vec = second-order biased random walk

        * consider previous node

    * sample nodes to reduce time for calculating loss

* recommendation system

    * Netflix challenge

    * Latent Factor Model

        * embed user and item

        * inner product of user and item should be high

        * find optimal latent factor of user and item (use L-2 regularization)

    * advanced latent factor model

        * rating would be biased

        * add normalize term (mean, user bias, item bias)

    * adopt time domain

        * movie's rating increases as time goes by

        * system change made significant increase of movie rating

    * Ensemble made high accuracy

* implementation

    * Node2Vec + (K-means algorithm / classification)

    * Surprise library , latent factor model

# Peer Session

* Community detection
